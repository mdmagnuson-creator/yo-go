# PRD: AI Toolkit v2 — Streamlining & Testing System

## Introduction

The AI toolkit has grown organically to 59 agents, 17 skills, and complex coordination systems. While the breadth is valuable for multi-project support, some areas are over-engineered and others are fragmented. This PRD addresses:

1. **Testing system consolidation** — Unify the 8+ testing agents into a coherent, automated system
2. **Work state tracking** — Resumable sessions with clear checkpoints for testing, docs, and commits
3. **Skill auto-generation** — Make meta-skills actually fire when projects need them
4. **Builder/Developer simplification** — Reduce the 1,400+ line builder.md without losing functionality
5. **Agent consolidation** — Merge overlapping agents where appropriate

## Goals

- Reduce cognitive overhead when understanding/maintaining the toolkit
- Create a robust, automated testing pipeline that generates tests after PRD/adhoc work
- Enable session resumption when work is interrupted
- Ensure skills are auto-generated when projects are bootstrapped or capabilities are added
- Keep the toolkit suitable for managing 5-10 projects simultaneously
- Prepare for team-based agent orchestration (multi-session) without over-engineering solo use

## Core Concept: Builder State Machine

Builder maintains a state file (`docs/builder-state.json`) that tracks:
- Active PRD work and progress
- Ad-hoc work queue
- Pending tests (generated but not run)
- Documentation/marketing updates needed
- Uncommitted changes

This enables:
- **Resumability** — If session drops, Builder picks up where it left off
- **Visibility** — User sees what's in progress, what's queued, what needs attention
- **Clear workflow** — Work → Tests → Docs → Commit flow is explicit

### State File Schema

## User Stories

### US-001: Builder State Tracking

**Description:** As a developer, I want Builder to track work state so I can resume interrupted sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Create `docs/builder-state.json` schema (see above) — created schemas/builder-state.schema.json
- [x] Builder writes state on: session start, todo completion, test generation, test run, commit
- [x] Builder reads state on startup and displays resume prompt if WIP exists
- [x] Heartbeat updated every action (configurable timeout, default 10 min)
- [x] Add `agents.heartbeatTimeoutMinutes` to project.json schema (default: 10) — added in US-002
- [x] Stale sessions (no heartbeat > timeout) shown as resumable

---

### US-002: Unified Testing Orchestrator

**Description:** As a developer, I want a single testing agent that intelligently orchestrates all test types.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Create `@test-orchestrator` agent (or repurpose `tester.md`) — using existing tester.md
- [x] Orchestrator reads `project.json` → `testing` config
- [x] Delegates to specialists: unit tests (jest/vitest/go), component tests (react), E2E (playwright)
- [x] Two modes: `--unit-only` (Story/Ad-hoc mode) and `--full` (Full Suite Mode with E2E)
- [x] Generates test files for changed code without existing coverage
- [x] Reports consolidated pass/fail results

**Testing Agent Hierarchy (after consolidation):**

```
@test-orchestrator (router)
  ├── @jest-tester (JS/TS unit tests)
  ├── @react-tester (React component tests)  
  ├── @go-tester (Go unit tests)
  ├── @playwright-dev (E2E test writing)
  └── @quality-critic (visual, a11y, performance)
```

- [x] E2E test scripts generated per story, queued for PRD completion
- [x] After ALL stories complete: run full E2E test suite
- [x] E2E failures → fix and re-run (loop until pass)
- [x] Tests committed as part of PRD: `test: add tests for [story-id]`

---

### US-004: Test Flow for Ad-hoc Work (Standalone)

**Description:** As a developer, I want a clear test flow when doing ad-hoc work outside a PRD.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] After ad-hoc todos complete: auto-generate and run unit tests (no prompt)
- [x] Unit test failures → fix before proceeding
- [x] E2E test scripts auto-generated (no prompt), added to pending queue
- [x] Prompt user: `Run E2E tests now, or keep working? [T]ests / [W]ork`
- [x] If "Work" → E2E tests stay queued, user continues
- [x] If "Tests" → run E2E suite, then proceed to docs/commit

---

### US-005: Test Flow for Ad-hoc During PRD

**Description:** As a developer, I want ad-hoc work during a PRD session to integrate with the PRD test flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Ad-hoc request during active PRD is tracked separately in `adhocQueue`
- [x] After ad-hoc todos complete: auto-generate and run unit tests
- [x] E2E test scripts generated, then prompt:
  ```
  Run E2E tests now, or defer to PRD completion?
    [N]ow - Run immediately
    [D]efer - Queue for PRD completion  
    [W]ork - Keep working (tests queued)
  ```
- [x] If "Defer" → E2E tests added to PRD's test queue
- [x] If "Now" → run E2E, then return to PRD work
- [x] Deferred tests run with full PRD suite at completion

---

### US-006: Auto-Detect Documentation/Marketing Updates

**Description:** As a developer, I want Builder to auto-detect when changes need support articles or marketing updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] After todos complete, Builder analyzes changed files:
  - Files in `app/(marketing)/` or `pages/marketing/` → marketing update needed
  - Files in `screenshot-registry.json` → screenshot update needed  
  - New user-facing components without docs → support article may be needed
- [x] Detected updates added to `pendingUpdates` in state
- [x] Builder shows pending updates in dashboard
- [x] Updates run after tests pass, before commit prompt
- [x] For ambiguous cases, prompt: `Does this change need a support article? [Y/n]`

---

**Description:** As a developer, I want a clear commit flow after tests and docs are complete.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] After tests pass AND docs complete → commit prompt
- [x] Add `agents.commitStrategy` to project.json:
  - `batch-per-session` (default): One commit for all work after tests pass
  - `per-todo`: One commit per completed todo
  - `manual`: Builder stages changes, user commits manually
- [x] Commit prompt shows: summary, files changed, test status, doc status
- [x] After commit → push prompt: `Push to remote? [Y/n]`
- [x] State cleared after successful push (or after commit if push declined)

- [x] Developer.md under 400 lines (actual: 328 lines)
- [x] No functionality lost

---

### US-013: Consolidate Testing Agents

**Description:** As a toolkit maintainer, I want clear 1:1 mapping of testing concern to agent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] ~~Merge `tester.md` and `qa.md` into single orchestrator~~ Decision: Keep qa.md separate (distinct purpose: exploratory QA testing)
- [x] Remove `e2e-tester.md` (redundant with `e2e-playwright.md`) — merged Full Suite Mode into tester.md
- [x] Clarify `qa-browser-tester.md` vs `qa-explorer.md`:
  - `qa-explorer` = explores app for bugs (manual QA simulation)
  - `qa-browser-tester` = writes Playwright tests for found bugs
  - Keep both, distinct purposes
- [x] Update all references to removed agents
- [x] Document final hierarchy in toolkit README

---

### US-014: Solo Developer Mode

**Description:** As a solo developer, I want simpler operation without team coordination overhead.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Add `agents.multiSession: false` to project.json (default: false) — already in schema
- [x] When false: skip session-locks, heartbeat, merge queue
- [x] Work directly on branches, push when ready
- [x] When true: full coordination system active
- [x] Builder dashboard simpler in solo mode (no session/lock info)

---

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: State file (`docs/builder-state.json`) written atomically on each state change
- FR-2: Unit tests auto-run after todo completion (no prompt)
- FR-3: E2E tests generated after todos, run by user prompt (or deferred)
- FR-4: Documentation/marketing updates auto-detected from changed files
- FR-5: Commit strategy configurable per project
- FR-6: Heartbeat timeout configurable per project (default 10 min)
- FR-7: Test orchestrator delegates based on file extension and project config
- FR-8: Skill generators write to project's `docs/skills/` directory
- FR-9: Solo mode skips coordination files entirely

## Non-Goals

- No changes to critic system (working well)
- No changes to PRD format
- No removal of language-specific dev agents
- No UI/dashboard for toolkit itself
- No automatic CI integration (toolkit generates, CI runs)

## Technical Considerations

- **State file location:** `docs/builder-state.json` (project-specific, gitignored)
- **Skill extraction:** Move workflow logic from builder.md into loadable skills
- **Backwards compatibility:** Projects without new config fields use defaults
- **Testing frameworks:** Support Jest, Vitest, Go testing, Playwright, pytest

## Success Metrics

- builder.md under 500 lines
- developer.md under 400 lines
- Session resumption works 100% of the time after interruption
- Clear 1:1 mapping of testing concern → agent
- Tests auto-generated for 100% of completed work
- Documentation updates auto-detected for 90%+ of UI changes

## Configuration Summary

New `project.json` fields:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "heartbeatTimeoutMinutes": 10,
    "commitStrategy": "batch-per-session",
    "multiSession": false
  },
  "testing": {
    "autoGenerate": true,
    "qualityChecks": false
  }
}
```
