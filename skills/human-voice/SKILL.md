# Human Voice Review

> Load this skill when: reviewing documentation, articles, or marketing copy for AI-generated patterns.

## Overview

AI-generated content has telltale patterns that make it feel robotic, overly formal, or artificially structured. This skill identifies these patterns and provides fixes to make writing sound more natural and human.

**Goal:** Content should read like it was written by a knowledgeable human, not generated by a machine.

## Red Flags to Find and Fix

### 1. Em Dash Overuse

AI loves em dashes — often using them multiple times per paragraph — when simpler punctuation works better.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `text — parenthetical — more text` | Nested em dashes are jarring | Use commas or parentheses |
| `concept — explanation` | Often unnecessary | Use a colon or period |
| Multiple em dashes per paragraph | Feels mechanical | Limit to one per paragraph max |

**Examples:**

```diff
- The feature — which was added last week — allows users to export data — including PDFs.
+ The feature, added last week, allows users to export data including PDFs.

- This approach — while effective — has limitations.
+ This approach is effective but has limitations.

- Configuration — see below — is straightforward.
+ Configuration (see below) is straightforward.
```

### 2. Excessive Structure

AI over-organizes content with unnecessary headers, bullet points, and numbered lists.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| H3 for 2-sentence sections | Over-structured | Merge into prose or remove header |
| Bullets for 2 items | Unnecessary | Write as a sentence |
| Numbered lists for non-sequential items | Implies order where none exists | Use bullets or prose |
| Every paragraph has a header | Feels like an outline | Combine related sections |

**Examples:**

```diff
- ### Overview
- This feature does X.
- 
- ### How It Works
- It works by doing Y.
+ This feature does X by doing Y.

- Benefits:
- - Fast
- - Reliable
+ It's fast and reliable.

- Steps:
- 1. Open settings
- 2. Click export
- 3. Choose format
+ Open settings, click export, and choose your format.
```

### 3. Filler Phrases

AI pads content with empty phrases that add length without meaning.

| Phrase | Problem | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| "It's important to note that..." | Filler | Just state the fact |
| "In order to..." | Verbose | Use "To..." |
| "It's worth mentioning that..." | Filler | Just mention it |
| "As you can see..." | Condescending | Remove |
| "Basically..." / "Essentially..." | Undermines the point | Remove |
| "In terms of..." | Vague | Be specific |
| "At the end of the day..." | Cliché | Remove |
| "It goes without saying..." | Then don't say it | Remove |
| "For all intents and purposes..." | Verbose | Remove or use "effectively" |
| "In the context of..." | Overly formal | Simplify |

**Examples:**

```diff
- It's important to note that the API requires authentication.
+ The API requires authentication.

- In order to export data, click the button.
+ To export data, click the button.

- It's worth mentioning that this is optional.
+ This is optional.
```

### 4. Overly Formal Tone

AI defaults to corporate-speak when casual language works better.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "utilize" | Pretentious | "use" |
| "leverage" | Jargon | "use" or "take advantage of" |
| "facilitate" | Corporate | "help" or "enable" |
| "implement" | Technical | "add" or "set up" |
| "subsequently" | Stiff | "then" or "after" |
| "prior to" | Formal | "before" |
| "in addition" | Verbose | "also" |
| "however" (starting sentence) | Overused | "But" or restructure |
| "therefore" | Academic | Often removable |
| "furthermore" | Essay-like | "Also" or remove |

**Examples:**

```diff
- Utilize the export feature to leverage your data.
+ Use the export feature to work with your data.

- Subsequently, the system will facilitate the transfer.
+ Then the system helps transfer the data.

- Prior to implementation, review the documentation.
+ Before setup, review the docs.
```

### 5. Redundant Modifiers

AI adds unnecessary qualifiers that weaken statements.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "very unique" | Unique is absolute | "unique" |
| "completely finished" | Finished is absolute | "finished" |
| "absolutely essential" | Essential is absolute | "essential" |
| "quite straightforward" | Hedging | "straightforward" |
| "relatively simple" | Hedging | "simple" |
| "fairly easy" | Hedging | "easy" |
| "really powerful" | Weak intensifier | "powerful" |
| "actually works" | Implies surprise | "works" |

**Examples:**

```diff
- This is a very unique approach that's quite straightforward.
+ This is a unique, straightforward approach.

- It's actually really powerful.
+ It's powerful.

- The process is fairly easy and relatively simple.
+ The process is easy.
```

### 6. Passive Voice Overuse

AI uses passive voice to sound "objective" but it weakens writing.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "can be configured" | Who configures it? | "you can configure" |
| "is used to" | Passive | "uses" or "lets you" |
| "should be noted" | Passive filler | State directly |
| "was implemented" | Hides actor | Name the actor |
| "are provided" | Passive | "we provide" or "includes" |

**Examples:**

```diff
- The data can be exported by clicking the button.
+ Click the button to export data.

- Authentication is handled by the server.
+ The server handles authentication.

- It should be noted that this requires admin access.
+ This requires admin access.
```

### 7. Unnecessary Transitions

AI over-connects sentences with transitions that aren't needed.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Starting every paragraph with "Additionally" | Repetitive | Vary or remove |
| "Moreover" | Essay-like | Often unnecessary |
| "Furthermore" | Too formal | "Also" or remove |
| "In conclusion" | Obvious | Remove or just conclude |
| "As mentioned earlier" | Reader remembers | Remove |
| "That being said" | Weak transition | Remove or use "But" |

**Examples:**

```diff
- Additionally, you can export to PDF. Furthermore, CSV is supported.
+ You can export to PDF or CSV.

- As mentioned earlier, authentication is required. That being said, guest access is available.
+ Authentication is required, but guest access is available.
```

### 8. Hollow Enthusiasm

AI adds artificial excitement that feels insincere.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "Exciting new feature!" | Forced | Describe the feature |
| "We're thrilled to..." | Corporate | Just announce it |
| "Amazing capabilities" | Hyperbole | Describe specifically |
| "Incredibly powerful" | Overblown | Explain what it does |
| "Seamlessly integrates" | Buzzword | "Integrates with" |
| "Robust solution" | Meaningless | Describe what's robust |

**Examples:**

```diff
- We're thrilled to announce this exciting new feature!
+ Here's what's new in this release.

- This incredibly powerful tool seamlessly integrates with your workflow.
+ This tool integrates with your existing workflow.

- Our robust solution provides amazing capabilities.
+ The system handles X, Y, and Z.
```

### 9. Repetitive Sentence Structure

AI often starts consecutive sentences the same way.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "This... This... This..." | Monotonous | Vary sentence starts |
| "You can... You can... You can..." | Repetitive | Combine or restructure |
| "The feature... The feature..." | Boring | Use pronouns or combine |

**Examples:**

```diff
- This feature exports data. This makes reporting easier. This saves time.
+ This feature exports data, making reporting easier and saving time.

- You can export to PDF. You can export to CSV. You can export to Excel.
+ Export to PDF, CSV, or Excel.
```

### 10. Over-Explaining the Obvious

AI states things the reader already knows or can infer.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "As you know..." | Condescending | Remove |
| "It goes without saying..." | Then don't say it | Remove |
| Explaining what a button does when it's labeled | Redundant | Remove |
| Restating the section title in the first sentence | Obvious | Get to the point |

**Examples:**

```diff
- ## Exporting Data
- This section explains how to export data.
+ ## Exporting Data
+ Click the Export button and choose your format.

- As you know, users need to log in before accessing the dashboard.
+ Users must log in to access the dashboard.
```

## Review Checklist

Run through this checklist when reviewing content:

```
□ Em dashes: Max 1 per paragraph, often replaceable
□ Structure: Headers earn their place (>3 sentences of content)
□ Bullets/lists: >2 items, truly parallel, necessary
□ Filler phrases: "It's important to note" and friends removed
□ Formal words: "utilize" → "use", "leverage" → "use"
□ Hedging: "quite", "fairly", "relatively" removed
□ Passive voice: Actor identified where possible
□ Transitions: Not every paragraph needs "Additionally"
□ Enthusiasm: Specific benefits, not hollow excitement
□ Sentence variety: Not starting 3+ sentences the same way
□ Obvious statements: Reader intelligence respected
```

## Quick Reference: Find and Replace

Common AI patterns to search for:

```
Search → Replace (or review)
----------------------------
" — "           → ", " or ": " or ". " (review each)
"It's important" → (delete phrase)
"It's worth"     → (delete phrase)
"In order to"    → "To"
"utilize"        → "use"
"leverage"       → "use"
"facilitate"     → "help" or "enable"
"subsequently"   → "then"
"prior to"       → "before"
"in addition"    → "also"
"furthermore"    → (delete or "also")
"however,"       → "But" (start of sentence)
"very unique"    → "unique"
"quite"          → (delete)
"fairly"         → (delete)
"relatively"     → (delete)
"actually"       → (delete)
"basically"      → (delete)
"essentially"    → (delete)
"seamlessly"     → (delete or be specific)
"robust"         → (be specific)
```

## Voice Guidelines

**Do:**
- Write like you're explaining to a smart colleague
- Use contractions (it's, you'll, don't)
- Start sentences with "And" or "But" when natural
- Use "you" to address the reader directly
- Keep sentences varied in length
- Let content breathe without constant headers

**Don't:**
- Sound like a press release
- Over-structure simple content
- Hedge every statement
- Use three words when one works
- Connect every sentence with transitions
- Celebrate features instead of explaining them

## Integration with Writing Agents

When used by `docs-writer`, `support-article-writer`, or `copy-critic`:

1. **First pass:** Write content focusing on accuracy and completeness
2. **Human voice pass:** Review with this checklist
3. **Read aloud test:** Does it sound like something a person would say?

The goal isn't to remove all structure or formality — it's to remove the *artificial* structure and formality that signals "a machine wrote this."
