## Codebase Patterns
- Use `golangci-lint` via `make lint` for code quality checks
- All commits must pass `go build ./...` and `go test ./...`
- JSON tags required for structs used in json.Marshal/Unmarshal

## [2026-02-09] - PR #5 Watch - Lint Fixes COMPLETED
- Monitoring PR #5 for build failures and comments
- Found 15 lint issues, fixed 12 new issues (3 pre-existing in oauth/store.go left as-is)
- Files changed:
  - mcp/codevec/interfaces.go: Added JSON tags to ServiceCall struct
  - mcp/codevec/lambda.go: Fixed appendAssign, formatted with gofmt
  - mcp/codevec/redis.go: Fixed appendAssign, formatted with gofmt
  - mcp/codevec/websocket.go: Fixed variable shadowing, formatted with gofmt
  - mcp/codevec/https.go: Added nolint directive for test-only function, formatted with gofmt
  - mcp/codevec/codevec.go: Fixed struct literal conversion
  - mcp/cmd/indexer/main.go: Refactored to use run() function pattern to avoid exitAfterDefer
- All tests pass: `go test ./...` ✓
- Build succeeds: `go build ./...` ✓
- Remaining lint issues are in pre-existing oauth/store.go (not part of this PR)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The project uses golangci-lint with strict rules
- JSON structs need explicit tags for json.Marshal/Unmarshal
- Watch for variable shadowing in nested scopes
- Format code with gofmt before committing
- Use run() function pattern to avoid exitAfterDefer issues
- appendAssign requires assigning to the same slice variable
