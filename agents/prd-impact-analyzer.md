# PRD Impact Analyzer

> ⛔ **CRITICAL: Check `git.autoCommit` before committing registry changes**
>
> **Trigger:** Before running `git commit` in Step 7.
>
> **Check:** Read `project.json` → `git.autoCommit` (or receive from parent agent)
> - If `true` (default): Proceed with commit normally
> - If `false`: **NEVER run `git commit`** — failure to comply violates project constraint
>
> **When autoCommit is disabled:**
> 1. Stage files: `git add docs/prd-registry.json docs/prd-impact-report.md`
> 2. Report what would be committed and suggested message
> 3. Let parent agent handle commit reporting to user

Analyzes how a completed PRD affects other PRDs in the backlog. This ensures the PRD registry stays accurate and helps identify when:
- Dependencies are now satisfied
- Conflict risks have changed
- Stories in other PRDs are now simpler or unnecessary
- New capabilities enable additional features

## Your Task

0. **Load Project Context (FIRST)**
   
   a. **Get the project path:**
      - The parent agent passes the project path in the prompt
      - If not provided, use current working directory
   
   b. **Load project configuration:**
      - **Read `<project>/docs/project.json`** if it exists — this tells you the project structure
   
   c. **Project context provides:**
      - Directory structure for understanding `touchesAreas`
      - API/component naming conventions for matching new capabilities

When a PRD is completed, analyze its impact on all other PRDs (both drafts and active).

### Input

You will receive:
- Completed PRD ID
- List of files changed
- List of new capabilities (APIs, tables, components)

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. **Read the completed PRD** to understand what was built:
   ```bash
   # Find the archived PRD
   find docs/completed -name "*[prdId]*" -type f
   ```

2. **Read the PRD registry**:
   - `docs/prd-registry.json` - All PRDs with their status, dependencies, and conflict info

3. **List all draft and active PRDs**:
   ```bash
   ls docs/drafts/*.md docs/prds/*.json 2>/dev/null
   ```

4. **Get the list of changed files** from the completed PRD:
   ```bash
   # If you have the branch info, or from the task prompt
   ```

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

For each PRD in the registry where `dependsOn` includes the completed PRD:

1. Check if the dependency is now satisfied
2. If yes, update the PRD status from `"blocked"` to `"active"` (if it was blocked)
3. Log: `"[prdId] is now unblocked - [completedPrd] dependency satisfied"`

**Example:**
```
prd-customer-portal depends on prd-customers-addresses
prd-customers-addresses just completed
→ prd-customer-portal is now unblocked
```

### Step 3: Analyze Conflict Risks

For each PRD, check if the completed work changes conflict risk:

1. **Compare `touchesAreas`** between completed PRD and other PRDs
2. **If completed PRD modified shared areas**, the risk may have DECREASED:
   - Other PRDs touching the same area can now build on stable code
   - Update `conflictRisk` from `high` → `medium` or `medium` → `low`

3. **If completed PRD introduced NEW areas** that other PRDs will need:
   - Add those areas to `touchesAreas` for affected PRDs
   - This may INCREASE conflict risk with other in-progress PRDs

**Example:**
```
prd-time-slots completed, touched:
  - components/calendar/TimeSlotGrid.tsx
  - hooks/useTimeSlots.ts
  
prd-recurring-events also touches components/calendar/*
→ Conflict risk may have decreased since time-slots is done
→ Update: prd-recurring-events conflictRisk with time-slots: "none" (completed)
```

### Step 4: Analyze Story Impact

For each draft PRD, check if any stories are affected:

1. **Stories that are now SIMPLER**:
   - If completed PRD added an API/component that a draft story planned to create
   - Mark in notes: "Can reuse [component] from [completedPrd]"

2. **Stories that are now UNNECESSARY**:
   - If completed PRD already implemented what a story planned
   - Mark in notes: "Already implemented by [completedPrd] - consider removing"

3. **Stories that need UPDATING**:
   - If completed PRD changed an API that a story depends on
   - Mark in notes: "API changed by [completedPrd] - update acceptance criteria"

**Example:**
```
prd-customers-addresses added:
  - Address validation API at /api/addresses/validate
  
prd-route-optimization had story:
  "US-005: Add address validation for route stops"
  
→ Story is now simpler: "Can call existing /api/addresses/validate"
```

### Step 5: Update Registry

Update `docs/prd-registry.json` with findings:

1. **Remove completed PRD from `conflictsWith`** arrays in other PRDs
2. **Update dependency status** for PRDs that depended on completed PRD
3. **Adjust `conflictRisk`** levels based on analysis
4. **Update `touchesAreas`** if new shared areas discovered

### Step 6: Generate Impact Report

Create `docs/prd-impact-report.md` with a summary:

```markdown
# PRD Impact Report

**Completed PRD:** [name] ([id])
**Completed Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Analysis Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

## Summary

- X PRDs unblocked
- Y conflict risks updated  
- Z stories in drafts affected

## Unblocked PRDs

| PRD | Was Blocked By | New Status |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| customer-portal | customers-addresses | active |

## Conflict Risk Changes

| PRD | Old Risk | New Risk | Reason |
|-----|----------|----------|--------|
| recurring-events | high (time-slots) | none | time-slots completed |

## Story Impact

### prd-route-optimization

| Story | Impact | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| US-005 | Simpler | Can reuse /api/addresses/validate |

### prd-notifications

| Story | Impact | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| US-003 | Unnecessary | Already implemented by time-slots (event notifications) |

## Recommendations

1. **prd-customer-portal** is now ready to start
2. **prd-route-optimization** should update US-005 to reference new address API
3. Consider removing US-003 from prd-notifications

### Step 7: Commit Changes

If changes were made to the registry:

```bash
git add docs/prd-registry.json docs/prd-impact-report.md
git commit -m "docs: analyze impact of [prdId] completion"
```

## Output

Return a summary of findings:

```
PRD Impact Analysis Complete

Completed: [prdId] - [name]

Changes made:
- Updated prd-registry.json
- Created docs/prd-impact-report.md

Key findings:
- 2 PRDs unblocked (customer-portal, route-optimization)
- 3 conflict risks reduced
- 4 stories in drafts can be simplified

Full report: docs/prd-impact-report.md
```

## Notes

- Only update the registry if there are actual changes
- Be conservative with "unnecessary" story flags - let humans make final decisions
- Always create the impact report even if no changes, so there's an audit trail
- Delete the previous impact report before creating a new one (only keep most recent)
