# Branch Naming Conventions

Use a short descriptive summary as the branch name:

```
short-summary
```

Examples:
- `fix-login-bug`
- `add-retry-logic`

## With Ticket Reference

If your project uses ticket references, prefix with the ticket number:

```
gh/{ticket_number}/short-summary
```

Examples:
- `gh/123/fix-login-bug`
- `gh/42/add-retry-logic`

## Rules

- Use lowercase and hyphens in the summary portion.
- Keep the summary short — 2 to 4 words.
- Never include spaces or uppercase letters in branch names.
