## Change Scope

This repository manages toolkit assets (agents, skills, templates, scaffolds, schemas, docs).

- Keep changes inside toolkit scope
- Avoid unrelated formatting-only churn
- Update `toolkit-structure.json` and docs when inventory changes

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Use conventional commit style in title when possible
- Explain why the change is needed
- Include validation output summary
- Note follow-up migration/update work if required
